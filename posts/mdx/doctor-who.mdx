# Heh-haa! Super squeaky bum time!

Father Christmas. Santa Claus. Or as I've always known him: Jeff. You know when grown-ups tell you 'everything's going to be fine' and you think they're probably lying to make you feel better? I hate yogurt. It's just stuff with bits in.

Heh-haa! Super squeaky bum time! You hit me with a cricket bat. It's art! A statement on modern society, 'Oh Ain't Modern Society Awful? **!** \*_Insistently_ Bow ties are cool!\* Come on Amy, I'm a normal bloke, tell me what normal blokes do!

## I am the Doctor, and you are the Daleks!

I'm nobody's taxi service; I'm not gonna be there to catch you every time you feel like jumping out of a spaceship. Saving the world with meals on wheels. Aw, you're all Mr. Grumpy Face today. All I've got to do is pass as an ordinary human being. Simple. What could possibly go wrong?

1. Sorry, checking all the water in this area; there's an escaped fish.

3. Stop talking, brain thinking. Hush.

### No… It's a thing; it's like a plan, but with more greatness.

You know how I sometimes have really brilliant ideas? Heh-haa! Super squeaky bum time! Annihilate? No. No violence. I won't stand for it. Not now, not ever, do you understand me?! I'm the Doctor, the Oncoming Storm - and you basically meant beat them in a football match, didn't you?

- You hate me; you want to kill me! Well, go on! Kill me! KILL ME!
- You know when grown-ups tell you 'everything's going to be fine' and you think they're probably lying to make you feel better?
- I am the last of my species, and I know how that weighs on the heart so don't lie to me!

Did I mention we have comfy chairs? I am the last of my species, and I know how that weighs on the heart so don't lie to me! I am the last of my species, and I know how that weighs on the heart so don't lie to me!

I'm the Doctor, I'm worse than everyone's aunt. _catches himself_ And that is not how I'm introducing myself. You've swallowed a planet! Aw, you're all Mr. Grumpy Face today. I'm the Doctor, I'm worse than everyone's aunt. _catches himself_ And that is not how I'm introducing myself.

You hit me with a cricket bat. It's a fez. I wear a fez now. Fezes are cool. Stop talking, brain thinking. Hush. I hate yogurt. It's just stuff with bits in. They're not aliens, they're Earth…liens!

Father Christmas. Santa Claus. Or as I've always known him: Jeff. All I've got to do is pass as an ordinary human being. Simple. What could possibly go wrong? The way I see it, every life is a pile of good things and bad things.…hey.…the good things don't always soften the bad things; but vice-versa the bad things don't necessarily spoil the good things and make them unimportant.

I am the last of my species, and I know how that weighs on the heart so don't lie to me! Stop talking, brain thinking. Hush. Saving the world with meals on wheels. Sorry, checking all the water in this area; there's an escaped fish.

I'm the Doctor. Well, they call me the Doctor. I don't know why. I call me the Doctor too. I still don't know why. Saving the world with meals on wheels. I am the last of my species, and I know how that weighs on the heart so don't lie to me!

No, I'll fix it. I'm good at fixing rot. Call me the Rotmeister. No, I'm the Doctor. Don't call me the Rotmeister. Aw, you're all Mr. Grumpy Face today. No, I'll fix it. I'm good at fixing rot. Call me the Rotmeister. No, I'm the Doctor. Don't call me the Rotmeister.
